# mt_optoIDR_scripts
## Droplet 1.0
Main scripts used to segment mt-opot-condensates from the mitochondrial network. 
This script calculate,   
-major and minor axis of segmented droplets (Full width at half max)   
-Aspect ratio of droplets   
-Partition coefficients    
and include all the x and y location details and other data calculated from the tackpy locate function 


## Orientation finder
This script calculates the orientation between mitochondrial axial axis and droplet major axis

## Tracker
This script contain  
-tracking functions,  
-function to isolate individual tracks,   
-Rotate track function,   
-function to calculate van-Hove plots for a given dimension,   
-function to calculate MSD for a given dimension.
